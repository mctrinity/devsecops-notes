# 🧱 DevSecOps Architecture Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture for implementing DevSecOps in a cloud-native environment using infrastructure as code, secure CI/CD pipelines, policy enforcement, and observability.

---

## 🌐 Core Components

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

- Tool: Terraform
- Deployed to: AWS, Azure, or multi-cloud
- Managed with: Remote state, modules, Git workflows

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline**

- Tool: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Stages:

  - Lint & test
  - Security scan (tfsec, Trivy)
  - OPA policy validation
  - Plan & apply infrastructure

### 3. **Secrets Management**

- Tools: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- Injected at runtime into pipeline jobs or applications

### 4. **Policy as Code**

- Tool: Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- Applied during plan and deploy stages to block misconfigured or insecure resources

### 5. **Monitoring & Alerting**

- Tools: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Trivy
- Custom dashboards & alerts for CPU, memory, disk, container health

## 🔐 Security Integration Points

| Layer      | Tools                       | Purpose                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| IaC        | tfsec, Checkov              | Scan Terraform for misconfigs             |
| Container  | Trivy, Grype                | Image vulnerability scanning              |
| Secrets    | Vault, AWS/Azure Key Vault  | Secure injection and access control       |
| CI/CD      | GitHub Actions + OPA        | Enforce policy, limit deploy to main only |
| Monitoring | Azure Monitor + Alert Rules | Runtime visibility and anomaly detection  |

## 🔄 DevSecOps Flow

1. Developer submits code → triggers CI
2. Code is tested, scanned, and validated
3. Terraform plan is generated and checked against policies
4. Manual approval (optional)
5. Infrastructure is deployed
6. Alerts are configured and monitored

---

## 📌 Notes

- All secrets and state should be stored securely
- Audit logs should be enabled for both pipeline and infrastructure
- Rego policies should be version-controlled and reviewed with IaC
