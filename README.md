# 🔐 DevSecOps Toolkit

Welcome to the **DevSecOps** repository — a comprehensive toolkit and framework to integrate **security as code** across the entire DevOps lifecycle.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project provides reusable modules, policies, automation scripts, and best practices to help teams implement **secure-by-default infrastructure**, CI/CD pipelines, container security, and runtime monitoring.

The goal: **Shift security left** and embed it into every stage of your development and operations process.
